# K8S Monitoring

- This lab will contain various tools and techniques for monitoring Kubernetes clusters.
- The tools will be installed in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
- The tools will be installed in a separate namespace called `monitoring`.
- This tururrial will cover :
  - Premetheus
  - Grafana
  - Loki
  - AlertManager
  - KubeStateMetrics
  - OpenTelemetry
  - Istio

## Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster running on your local machine or in the cloud.
- Helm installed on your local machine.

## OpenTelemetry

- OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework for cloud-native software.
- It provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to enable observability for applications.
- It supports various programming languages and frameworks, making it easy to instrument applications for monitoring and tracing.
- OpenTelemetry provides a unified way to collect and export telemetry data, such as metrics, logs, and traces, from applications to various backends.
- It helps developers and operators gain insights into the performance and behavior of their applications, enabling them to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.
