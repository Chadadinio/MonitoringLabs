| **Prometheus**      | An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores metrics as time series data, providing powerful querying and alerting capabilities.                                                                 |
| **Grafana**         | A visualization and analytics platform that connects to various data sources, including Prometheus, to create interactive dashboards and graphs for monitoring and analysis.                                                                                        |
| **Loki**            | A log aggregation system from Grafana Labs that is designed to work seamlessly with Prometheus and Grafana, enabling efficient, cost-effective log collection and querying.                                                                                         |
| **Alloy**           | An open-source, programmable telemetry collector that unifies metrics, logs, and traces collection, making observability pipelines more flexible and easier to manage.                                                                                              |
| **Alertmanager**    | A component of the Prometheus ecosystem that handles alerts sent by Prometheus, managing silencing, inhibition, grouping, and routing to ensure reliable and configurable alert notifications.                                                                      |
| **Keda**            | An open-source Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler that enables applications to scale dynamically based on external event sources, such as message queues, databases, or custom metrics, providing fine-grained and efficient scaling for container workloads. |
| **OpenTelemetry**   | An open-source observability framework that provides a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to collect distributed traces, metrics, and logs from applications, enabling end-to-end visibility and analysis across complex systems.                  |
| **VictoriaMetrics** | A high-performance, cost-effective, and scalable time series database and monitoring solution, designed for storing and querying large volumes of metrics data efficiently.                                                                                         |
| **K8sGPT**          | An open-source tool and AI-powered assistant for Kubernetes that analyzes cluster resources, diagnoses issues, and provides human-readable explanations to help troubleshoot and maintain healthy Kubernetes environments.                                          |
